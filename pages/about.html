    <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
    <p>My journey with programming began at age 11, driven by curiosity. By 14, that curiosity had evolved into a genuine passion. To me, coding is the ultimate creative outlet; it is a highly logical process which aligns with how I think and solve problems. I recently achieved a Grade 9 in GCSE Computer Science and have now progressed to studying Computer Science and Mathematics at A-Level. One of my favorite aspects of development is the challenge of making programs significantly more efficient, a process which I find incredibly satisfying.</p>
    <h2>CURRENT PROJECTS</h2>
    <p>In my free time, I am balancing two distinct projects. The first is “ACorporateWorld”, a project built using Rust and WGSL (via Glfw/Wgpu). This has been a six-month deep dive into the mechanics of game engines and GPU programming. It has undergone multiple rendering overhauls as I’ve experimented with visual styles; currently, I’m focusing on an ultra-modern, executive-room aesthetic. You can see the evolution of this in my projects section.</p>
    <p>My second project is "mini-NEA" for school. While smaller in scope, working with Pygame has been an interesting way to prepare for my formal A-Level coursework and has given me a different perspective on python.</p>
    <p>Also, this website is a project I have worked on over the past week, and I have found it alluring, although a lot of the code is just recodes of my previous websites.</p>
    <h2>HISTORY</h2>
    <p>Over the past few years, I’ve explored various languages and platforms. One of my most significant early projects was Bayograde, a Java-based war game for Minecraft inspired by Hearts of Iron IV made with Minestom. It featured complex systems for troops and research, and it remains a milestone as my first "proper" project.
        I also experimented with mobile development by building a Flashcards Android app. This evolved into a cross-platform version where I implemented a central class system to keep the logic consistent across devices. While the web version ultimately served as a learning exercise for encryption and secure logins, the project was invaluable for understanding how to develop the Android ecosystem.</p>
    <h2>PROFESSIONAL GOALS & WORK EXPERIENCE</h2>
    <p>For my work experience, I am eager to step outside of my solo environment. I want to understand how a professional development team functions and how digital innovation is managed at scale. My primary goal is to bridge the gap between "hobbyist" and "professional" and I want to see how that passion translates into a collaborative career in the industry.</p>
    <h2>ASPIRATIONS</h2>
    <p>Following my A-Levels, I aspire to complete a BSc Computer Science-related degree, ideally as part of a Degree Apprenticeship. I am committed to turning my technical curiosity into a career where I can build impactful, high-performance software.</p>
